# CatBoostRegressor-Model
This model is part of a Kaggle competition in which I participate, This model is part of a Kaggle competition in which I participate, in which the aim is to create the best model given a data set.

### Kaggle

Kaggle is a web platform where public competitions are published to develop the best predictive model. To do this, you are provided with a training and a test data set. The training one has all the variables but the test one lacks the variable to predict. The idea is that you build a model and upload a .csv file with the data you have obtained from the variable to be predicted with the training set. This is recorded on the website and when the competition ends, your final score is shown and your ranking is announced.

The statement of this competition is the following:
"The purpose of this competition is to guess the price of a car using its characteristics. Not all characteristics can be used when predicting the price. Make predictions using machine learning algorithms or deep learning networks."

### Data

In this repository you will find the model that I have developed step by step and the respective training and test .csv files so that you can implement it.
